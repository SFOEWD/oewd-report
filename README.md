# oewd-report

## Installing

The template can be instantiated with the following command:

```bash
quarto use template SFOEWD/oewd-report
```

This will install the extension and create an example qmd file that you can use as a starting place for your report. Note that [the sficons extension](https://github.com/SFOEWD/sficons) is also included.
